      <p>When you&#39;re feeling better &amp; next looking at your auto-gen script bits on chatgpt, can you give me a clue how it might conceivably work for this : in the background I have chatgpt working on the lisp.py again, this time on /mnt/data/ (hopefully).
 First target would be to package it up in such a way as to run and behave as a Lisp repl. I&#39;ve seen there are published GPTs and they&#39;ve just announced there&#39;ll be a Store. Haven&#39;t a clue how that might tie in... 
The latest at <a href="https://github.com/danja/lispy">https://github.com/danja/lispy</a> 
lispy.py basically works (the &#39;unless&#39; keyword isn&#39;t implemented properly and the test file isn&#39;t hooked up properly).
This is totally toy but I can imagine your share/generate kind of things could be really cool for the xmpp agents. Also, side hustles..?
I&#39;d better do some of this proofreading...
(Grr, and my net is intermittent)</p>
